      <h2>Why Your Headset Is Your Most Important Piece of Gear</h2>
      <p>A top-tier aviation headset isn't just about comfort — it's about protecting your hearing, reducing fatigue on long flights, and ensuring crystal-clear communication in noisy cockpits.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Top 3 Headsets for 2025</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Bose A30</strong> — The gold standard in Active Noise Reduction (ANR). Lightweight, exceptional clarity, and Bluetooth connectivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightspeed Zulu 3</strong> — Best balance of comfort, features, and value. Great for long-haul pilots.</li>
        <li><strong>David Clark ONE-X</strong> — Most durable passive headset with excellent passive noise attenuation.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Pro Tip from Captain Ahmed</h2>
      <p>"Don't buy new if you don't have to. Many pilots upgrade every few years — you can find barely-used Bose or Lightspeed headsets on PilotWardrobe for 40-60% off retail."</p>

      <h2>Extend the Life of Your Investment</h2>
      <p>A $1,000+ headset can last decades with proper care. Here's how:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Clean ear seals regularly with mild soap and water</li>
        <li>Replace gel ear seals every 18-24 months</li>
        <li>Store in a protective case when not in use</li>
        <li>Check cables for wear and replace microphone muff</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Pro tip: Many "broken" headsets just need new ear seals or a cable — much cheaper than buying new!</p>
